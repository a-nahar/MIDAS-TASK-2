# MIDAS-TASK-2

#### This task is divided into three parts-
1) Create A Cnn network for a mullticlass classifiaction
2) Train the Model on the Mnist dataset, by using the pretrained model part-1
3) Train the model on the Provided noisy dataset,and test the accuracy on Mnist test set.

#### This repo Consists 3 Notbooks for each part of the task, Compelete explantion is provided in notebook itlself
for part 1 The repo  is : MIDAS_TASK_2_PART_1
    part 2 The repo  is : MIDAS_TASK_2_PART_2
    part 3 The repo  is : MIDAS_TASK_2_PART_3
    
I have used the Keras api (tensorflow backend) to build the model,and use the Google colab platform.

All the refernce material is being attached at the end of the part 1 Notebook.

### Version of the Library used in Notebooks:

----phython version     : 3.7.10

----numpy version       : 1.19.5

----Tensorflow version  : 2.4.1

----matplotlib version  : 3.2.2

#### There is alot of work is done on hyperparameter tunning,Model selection,etc.
#### A complete experiment log(jyputer notebook) is available on the repo(EXPERIMENT_LOG).
